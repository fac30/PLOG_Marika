## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
- Created templates for key pages, including Projects, Organisations, and Resources, to provide structured layouts for dynamic content. I also built a front-page template to link section titles (Projects, Organisations, Resources) to their respective pages.

- Created folders to categorise posts by section (Projects, Organisations, Resources) and used tags to filter topics. For example, tags like "Education," "Art," and "Community Tool" were added to improve navigation.

- Understanding pages/posts:
- Posts: Used for dynamic content that can be categorised and tagged for filtering.
- Pages: Used for static content that is not intended for frequent updates.

- I dynamically filter and display content based on tags using Query Blocks. For instance, I added tags like 'Education,' 'Art,' and 'Event' to various posts. This allows users to filter and view content tailored to their interests directly on the site, enhancing the browsing experience. This process involves configuring Query Blocks to fetch posts tagged with specific terms and displaying them in the posts.

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
- Built post templates for different sections (Projects, Organisations, Resources). Although WordPress does not allow inserting templates into posts directly, I resolved this by creating Patterns (reusable components) that serve as pre-configured layouts for posts.
This workaround ensures the product owner can easily add content by filling in pre-set blocks with images and text, maintaining a consistent design.

Overcoming this limitation deepened my problem-solving skills. The use of Patterns was a creative solution to deliver a customised experience while adhering to WordPressâ€™s constraints.
